# üèÜ GOLD STANDARD BASELINE

**Date:** December 29, 2025
**Version:** v1.0-gold-standard
**Status:** WORKING - Near Perfect Reflection Flow

## Overview

This baseline represents a fully functional BeAligned‚Ñ¢ Lite MVP with intelligent phase progression, empathetic AI responses, and proper prompt usage throughout the 7-phase reflection journey.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Intelligent Phase Progression
- Context-based interpretation (NOT keyword matching)
- Simple word count thresholds for progression
- Respects user readiness signals
- Smooth transitions between phases

### 2. Authentic AI Responses
- Genuine empathy without saccharine language
- No "Oh, friend" or artificial phrases
- Appropriate emotional weight matching
- Deep acknowledgment for heavy topics (addiction, abuse, illness)

### 3. Exact Prompt Usage
- Each phase uses its designated prompt
- Step 4 correctly asks about co-parent's perspective
- No improvisation or off-topic questions
- Clear, consistent BeAligned‚Ñ¢ methodology

## Perfect Flow Example

From actual user testing on December 29, 2025:

1. **Step 1 - Named Issue:** "I'm concerned my co-parent may be struggling with mental illness"
2. **Step 2 - Feelings:** "I'm concerned my sons may not ever have a true relationship with their mom"
3. **Step 3 - Values:** "It's all about family unit"
4. **Step 4 - Co-parent Perspective:** "She would say I'm just making it up to make her look bad"
5. **Step 5 - Child's View:** "They just see their parents in conflict"
6. **Step 6 - Options:** "Truthfully, I don't know how to navigate this"
7. **Step 7 - Synthesis:** Complete, compassionate summary with CLEAR message

## Technical Configuration

### Edge Function Logic
- Simplified decision framework with MANDATORY ACTION instructions
- Pre-calculated progression decisions based on word count
- Clear rules for each step
- Fallback handling for errors

### Database Schema
- `phase_progression_feedback` - Learns from admin corrections
- `phase_progression_patterns` - Stores learned patterns
- `refined_responses` - High-confidence examples for common scenarios
- Confidence scoring system (0.95+ for admin edits)

### Frontend Features
- Admin mode with phase progression controls
- OpenAI prompt visibility
- Refined response indicators
- Time-adaptive warm greetings
- Completion page with new reflection option

## Deployment Status

- **Frontend:** Running on Vite dev server
- **Edge Functions:** Deployed to Supabase (kzuumrtbroooxpneybyx)
- **Database:** Migrations applied through SQL editor
- **Environment:** All API keys configured

## Critical Code Sections

### Phase Progression Rules (Edge Function)
```typescript
PROGRESSION RULES:
- Step 1: Progress if 5+ words OR any second response
- Step 2: Progress if 3+ words (feelings) OR any second response  
- Step 3: Progress if 5+ words (values) OR any second response
- Step 4: Progress if 3+ words (perspective) OR any second response
- Step 5-7: Progress after any response
```

### Forbidden Phrases
```typescript
FORBIDDEN PHRASES: "Oh, friend" / "Oh my heart" / "Oh dear"
```

## How to Revert to This Baseline

If future changes break the flow:

```bash
# View this baseline
git show v1.0-gold-standard

# Revert to this baseline
git checkout v1.0-gold-standard

# Or create a new branch from baseline
git checkout -b fix-from-baseline v1.0-gold-standard
```

## Next Steps

Any future refinements should:
1. Maintain the current phase progression logic
2. Keep the authentic, grounded tone
3. Preserve exact prompt usage
4. Test against the example flow above
5. Ensure admin training features remain functional

## Success Metrics

‚úÖ Proper phase progression on appropriate responses
‚úÖ No "Oh, friend" or overly saccharine language
‚úÖ Step 4 asks about co-parent perspective (not hopes)
‚úÖ Completion produces meaningful synthesis
‚úÖ Admin can train the system effectively
‚úÖ Refined responses apply when available
